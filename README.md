This project is an attempt to create a reusable mobile architecture that follows some of the aspects of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) and is mostly written in Kotlin and makes use of [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) bundled with a couple of libraries.
