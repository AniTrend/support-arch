/**
 * A class that performs work synchronously on a background thread provided by [androidx.work.WorkManager].
 *
 * Worker classes are instantiated at runtime by WorkManager and the [androidx.work.Worker.doWork] method is
 * called on a pre-specified background thread (see [androidx.work.Configuration.getExecutor]).  This
 * method is for **synchronous** processing of your work, meaning that once you return from that
 * method, the Worker is considered to be finished and will be destroyed.  If you need to do your
 * work asynchronously or call asynchronous APIs, you should use [androidx.work.ListenableWorker].
 *
 * In case the work is preempted for any reason, the same instance of Worker is not reused.  This
 * means that [androidx.work.Worker.doWork] is called exactly once per Worker instance.
 * A new Worker is created if a unit of work needs to be rerun.
 *
 * A Worker is given a maximum of ten minutes to finish its execution and return a
 * [androidx.work.ListenableWorker.Result].  After this time has expired, the Worker will be
 * signalled to stop.
 *
 * @since v0.9.X
